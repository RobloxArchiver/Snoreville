I am busy trying to figure out how to replace functions and that codecave shit etc and allat. Probably easier to do this in C++ at this rate but I am so stupid I'd mess that up lol. I don't wanna skid a random client just to make my own, plus it would be different in Py. Cooler I guess. My final goal is to make a simple API in the end. This should take me 20-30 years!

# I am so bad at finding addresses and that shit, this is gonna take me 15 more years. :sob:
