This cheat is made for Roblox UWP/Windows 10 Edition. This is the Roblox version targeted.

This will NOT have a lua executor unless I was to figure that out with time and testing.
This cheat will target specific games.

Inspired by https://github.com/XanOpiat/Python-CSGO-Cheat and a few other cheats.
